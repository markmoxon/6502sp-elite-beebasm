\   Category: Screen mode
\    Summary: VDU commands for setting the square mode 4 screen
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This block contains the bytes that get passed to the VDU command (via OSWRCH)
\ in part 2 to set up the screen mode. This defines the whole screen using a
\ square, monochrome mode 4 configuration; the mode 5 part is implemented in the
\ IRQ1 routine.
\
\ Elite's monochrome screen mode is based on mode 4 but with the following
\ differences:
\
\   * 32 columns, 31 rows (256 x 248 pixels) rather than 40, 32
\
\   * The horizontal sync position is at character 45 rather than 49, which
\     pushes the screen to the right (which centres it as it's not as wide as
\     the normal screen modes)
\
\   * Screen memory goes from &6000 to &7EFF, which leaves another whole page
\     for code (i.e. 256 bytes) after the end of the screen. This is where the
\     Python ship blueprint slots in
\
\   * The text window is 1 row high and 13 columns wide, and is at (2, 16)
\
\   * There's a large, fast-blinking cursor
\
\ This almost-square mode 4 variant makes life a lot easier when drawing to the
\ screen, as there are 256 pixels on each row (or, to put it in screen memory
\ terms, there's one page of memory per row of pixels). For more details of the
\ screen mode, see the PIXEL subroutine in elite-source.asm.
\
\ There is also an interrupt-driven routine that switches the bytes-per-pixel
\ setting from that of mode 4 to that of mode 5, when the raster reaches the
\ split between the space view and the dashboard. This is described in the IRQ1
\ routine below, which does the switching.

\
\ The envelopes are as follows:
\
\   * Envelope 1 is the sound of our own laser firing
\
\   * Envelope 2 is the sound of lasers hitting us, or hyperspace
\
\   * Envelope 3 is the first sound in the two-part sound of us dying, or the

\
\   * Envelope 4 is the sound of E.C.M. firing
